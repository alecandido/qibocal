# Example of a high level action (executing circuits instead of pulse sequences) qcvv
# Qcvv will generate an error if the high-level runcard does not contain the following parameters:
# - backend: qibo backend ( "numpy", "tensorflow", "qibojit", "qibolab" )
# - platform: platform where the circuit will be executed (for simulation you must set None)
# - nqubits: number of qubits
# - format: format for storing data
# - actions: routines to be execute with the corresponding arguments


backend: qibolab

platform: tii5q

qubits: [0, ]

format: pickle

actions:
    test:
      nshots: 100
      points: 1
