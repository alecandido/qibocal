Executing a script for quantum hardware does not work:

Make sure ``qibo`` and ``qibolab`` are up-to-date on your machine.
    1. Go to qibo folder:
        ``git checkout master``
        ``git pull``
        ``pip install -e .``

    2. Go to qibolab
        ``git checkout master``
        ``git pull``
        ``pip install -e .[tiiq]``

Visit https://github.com/qiboteam/qrccluster/wiki/QPU-Status for checking which partition to take.
For example, if the partition name is ``tii1q_b1``:
    Write the partition name in the runcard, first line as ``platform: tii1q_b1```
    Wirte the same name ``#SBATCH --partition=tii1q_b1`` in the .sh file which calles the runcard
